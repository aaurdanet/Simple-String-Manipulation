String Manipulation Program

This C program allows users to perform various operations on a string, including printing it forward and backward, vertically, and as a triangle. Additionally, the program counts the number of characters in the entered string.
Features

    Forward Printing: Displays the entered string in its original order.
    Vertical Printing: Prints each character of the string on a new line vertically.
    Triangle Printing: Forms a triangle pattern using the characters of the string.
    Backward Printing: Reverses the string and prints it backward.
    Character Counting: Calculates and displays the number of characters in the entered string.

Prerequisites

    This program is written in C and assumes a C compiler is available.

Instructions

    Clone the repository or download the source code file.
    Compile the code using a C compiler.
    Run the compiled executable.

Usage

    Enter a string when prompted.
    View the different representations of the entered string.

Code Explanation

    The program uses a do-while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input.
    Various operations such as forward printing, vertical printing, triangle printing, backward printing, and character counting are performed on the entered string.
    The _strrev function is used to reverse the string.
